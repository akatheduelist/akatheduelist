<p>I am a software developer with a background in IT management and engineering. I have had a life-long passion for technology ever since my family came home with our first computer. I started writing code when I was a kid making web pages and connecting computers together with software and hardware has been an obsession of mine ever since. I received a degree in Unix/Linux Information Systems in college and I have spent the past decade in managing enterprise network and systems infrastructure, network security, project management, and many other aspects of the IT field.

More recently, I've embarked on a personal challenge to pivot my career towards software engineering. This endeavor has been a chance for me to learn new languages and frameworks and bring me back to the roots of what got me interested in technology in the first place, building things.

I would love to connect about building something with you!
