<p>From the moment my family brought home our first computer, I became fascinated with the possibilities of what it could do. This sparked a life-long passion for technology. I started writing my first code when I was a kid and making fan websites was an obsession of mine in middle school. When I graduated high-school I went into a Unix/Linux Information Systems program in college which gained me my first real job in the tech industry. I have spent the past decade in network and systems engineering, network security, project management, and department management in the Healthcare IT field.

More recently, I've embarked on a personal challenge to pivot my career towards software engineering. This endeavor has been a chance to learn something new and bring me back to the roots of what got me interested in technology in the first place, building things.
