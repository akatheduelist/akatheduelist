<p>My first computer was a Macintosh Performa 6360 and from the moment we brought it home I was obsessed with learning how it worked. This sparked a life-long passion for technology. I started writing my first code around 12 and making GeoCities and AngleFire websites was an obsession of mine in middle school. When I graduated high-school I went into a Unix/Linux Information Systems program in college which gained me my first real job in the tech industry. I have spent the past 12+ years in network and systems engineering, network security, project management, and department management in the Healthcare IT field.

Recently, I challenged myself to change my focus to software engineering. This endevour has been a chance to learn something new and bring me back to the roots of what got me interested in technology in the first place, building things.</p>
